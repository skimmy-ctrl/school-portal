# School Portal – Full Stack Application

This is my first full-stack project, built to understand how frontend and backend systems work together in a real-world application.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: (MongoDB / PostgreSQL / None yet – be honest)
- Authentication: (JWT / In progress)

## Features
- User authentication (login & register)
- Admin dashboard
- Student dashboard
- Timetable management
- API-based communication between frontend and backend

## What I Learned
- Connecting a React frontend to a backend API
- Handling authentication and protected routes
- Structuring a full-stack project
- Working with REST APIs
- Managing state across the application

## Status
This project is still in development and is being actively improved as I continue learning backend development.

## Why This Project
I built this project to move beyond frontend-only development and gain hands-on experience with full-stack workflows.
